**Game Description:**
* Alien meets Platforms is a 3D platformer game that allows the user to throw fireballs to destroy crates, roll under objects and bounce off jump pads. The goal of the game is to collect all 10 coins and to make it to all 3 checkpoints in as fast as possible by traversing through the platformer.

**What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal?**
* The hardest part of the game was setting up the character animations. I downloaded my animations from Mixamo.com, however some of the animations moved out of place or contained a different root bone, meaning I had to alter the animation in Maya to create a new root bone. I tried to get the AI to animate properly as well, but they wouldn't transition past the idle animation in the blueprints I made, So I assigned a random "moving" animation to them.

**What is the most interesting part of the game?**
* Definetly the funny character interactions that were & werent intended. As my fireball is rigged to my character model, if I shoot a fireball at a coin it picks it up as well as configuring my AI to contain a different set of animations to chase me around with. Coins can be hidden inside of objects
